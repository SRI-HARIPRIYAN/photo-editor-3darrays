This project implements a photo editor using a novel approach: representing images as 3D arrays. This allows for efficient manipulation of pixel data, enabling various image editing functionalities.

Key Features

Image Loading and Display: Supports loading images in various formats and displaying them on the interface.
Pixel Manipulation: Offers tools to modify individual pixel values, providing granular control over image content.
Color Adjustments: Includes features for adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, and other color parameters.
Filters: Implements a range of filters to enhance or stylize images, such as grayscale, sepia, and blur.
Transformations: Enables basic image transformations like rotation, flipping, and resizing.
Technical Implementation

3D Array Representation: Images are stored as 3D arrays, where the first two dimensions represent pixel coordinates, and the third dimension contains color channels (RGB).
Efficient Algorithms: Optimized algorithms are used for image processing operations, ensuring performance.
User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the photo editor.
