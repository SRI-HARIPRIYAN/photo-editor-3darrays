This project implements a photo editor using a novel approach: representing images as 3D arrays.
This allows for efficient manipulation of pixel data, enabling various image editing functionalities.

KEY FEATURES:-

1. Image Loading and Display: Supports loading images in various formats and displaying them on the interface.
   
2. Pixel Manipulation: Offers tools to modify individual pixel values, providing granular control over image content.
   
3.Transformations: Enables basic image transformations like rotation, flipping, and resizing.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATON:-

3D Array Representation: Images are stored as 3D arrays, where the first two dimensions represent pixel coordinates,
                          and the third dimension contains color channels (RGB).
                          
Efficient Algorithms: Optimized algorithms are used for image processing operations, ensuring performance.

User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the photo editor.
